# UA Cyber SHIELD

*CAUTION! We do not support unlawful attacks or malware campaigns that cause technical harm. We provide you with a tool which you can use, but we are not telling or advising you on what to do with it. YOU are responsible of what you choose to do with it !!!! We are just providing a tool JUST LIKE thousands of others on Github. If we give you a hammer - YOU are responsible of what you choose to knock with it !*

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-latest-blue)](https://github.com/opengs/uashield/releases/latest)

## For cyber defenders

1. You can find binaries on [releases page](https://github.com/opengs/uashield/releases)
2. Find the [latest release](https://github.com/opengs/uashield/releases/latest) and your platform
3. Download and run the binary file

**Running on Linux may require an additional `--no-sandbox` argument. Windows doesn't require any additional arguments to run.**

## How it works

Our volunteer defense center does all the hard work: monitoring targets, running technical infrastructure, coordinating attack targets, synchronizing it with client applications, etc.
When an attack is performed, the application gets the data it needs automatically.
The only thing you need to do is to install and run it.
Targets being attacked are changed automatically and are downloaded from the control center/server.

## Program interface

![A working example](docs/working.png)

## Run from source code

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/opengs/uashield.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd uashield && npm install`
3. Run build: `npm run build:electron`
4. Run the binary from `./dist/electron` or electron version: `npm run start:electron`

## Headless version (Docker)

1. Build an image: `docker build . -t uashield`
2. Run: `docker run uashield --workers=512 --withProxy=true` - where --workers=`512` - threads count, and --withProxy=`true` | `false` whether you want to use proxies

Complete command help: `docker run uashield --help`

Or use [pre-built image](https://github.com/opengs/uashield/pkgs/container/uashield):

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/opengs/uashield:master --workers=512 --withProxy=true
```

## Docker-compose version

1. Run: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Edit variables `WORKERS` and `USEPROXY` in file `docker-compose.yml` - where `256` - threads count, and `true` | `false` whether you want to use proxies

## Donations
